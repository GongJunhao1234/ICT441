    <p id="p1"><h1 >ICTAUT501 Manage robotic process automation</h1></p>

         engagement, and productivity by removing mundane tasks from their workdays.

    <p id="p1"><h1 >ICTWEB501 Build a dynamic website   </h1></p>
    <p>Many people today want and hope to build dynamic (data driven) web presences, the architectures of which readily accommodate new material, revision, and visitor 
        interaction. wikiHow for instance is a dynamic website. While the goal of quality projects is within the reach of all diligent people, it would be a mistake to 
        underestimate what in the end is a substantially challenging task, particularly in the technical objects of any prospective project. Even the simplest dynamic 
        web presences require sufficient skills in a variety of disciplines.

    <p id="p2"><h1 >ICTNWK502 Implement secure encryption technologies</h1></p>
    <p>Data encryption is a common and effective security method—a sound choice for protecting an organization’s information. However, there are a handful of different 
        encryption methods available, so how do you choose?

    <p id="p2"><h1 >ICTNWK527 Manage an enterprise virtual computing environment</h1></p>
    <p>Enterprise Virtual Computing Environment is important for people working in the networking department. Networking in any environment must be designed in such a way 
        that it enhances the organization to sustain itself in the coming future. In common terms, an enterprise must be viewed as a going concern. Any incident which hampers
         this concept must be immediately looked into and get resolved.
